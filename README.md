## Instructions

Before cloning this repository to a local repository, complete the following steps in the remote repository on the GitHub web site:

1. Create a project. See [Projects](#Projects) below.
1. Open two to three initial issues. See [Issues](#Issues) below. E.g. `Create index.html page`
1. Double check that the issues have been opened to the **To do** column in the selected project board.

After cloning this remote repository from GitHub to a local repository for the practice lab, complete the following steps in the local repository:

1. Set your user name and email using the `git config` command. E.g. `git config user.name "your name"` and `git config user.email "your email address"`. Check that the correct username and email is set using the `git config -l` command. This needs to be done every time the remote repository is cloned to a local repository.
1. Create a branch named **develop** off the main branch and push the branch to the remote repository. E.g. `git push -u origin develop` Creation of files for the lab should not start until the **develop** branch has been pushed to the remote repository.
1. Checkout the **develop** branch.
1. Edit this README.md file, then add your name, the current date and the lab number at the top. Save the change, stage the change and then commit the change.
1. Push the changes to the remote repository. E.g. `git push`

To keep the **main** and **develop** in sync, complete the following steps in the local repository:

1. Checkout the **main** branch. E.g. `git checkout main`
1. Merge the **develop** branch into the **main** branch. E.g. `git merge develop`
1. Push the changes to the remote repository. E.g. `git push`

1. When the changes are complete:
    1. test the changes
    1. add the file(s) to the staging area
    1. commit the changes
    1. checkout the **develop** branch
    1. execute a `git pull` to get the latest code from the remote repository

1. Delete the branch previously created for coding the changes from the local and remote repositories.

Repeat these steps each time changes are to be made. **NOTE**: Ensure that a `git pull` is regularly executed while checked out on the **develop** branch to get any changes have been pushed to the develop branch.
